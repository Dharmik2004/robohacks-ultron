On a never-ending journey to annoy people and put an end to mankind. Will you join me? Oops, you are gonna end anyway poor human.


### Original About
```So I am stuck on something. I have messaged in Blahajgang, so till someone reads my message and helps me do I am thinking to do. Till someone replies, I am gonna edit this thing.```

So I present a evil bot who is trying to end humans. If you disturb him, he will tell you how smart he is. 

He might be evil, but Ultron's understand's human emotions and words like die, suicide and sad and many more trigger him. He tries to comfort others when he reads negative stuff.

According to the knowledge he has gained after coming in existence by Dharmik Stark, (Read this Dharmik Stark thing again and again. LOL.) he thinks that humans are always free and can't be busy anytime. So, whenever he sees a Homo sapien type that he is busy, he responds with a sarcastic weird look.


~~This bot is going to solve world hunger and maybe can solve the chaos that Blahajgangers cause.~~ (I am not able to strikethrough this previous sentence. lol)


This bot also replies with a cool GIF when heavy words like improvements and humans are mentioned. You are a sickness.
